# Image-Super-Resolution-using-SRGAN

In our project, we replicate the SRGAN framework, aiming
to understand its intricacies and to explore its potential for 4X
upscaling of images. We delve into the neural network’s ability to
recover photo-realistic textures from significantly downsampled
images. Our endeavor does not extend to new methodologies or
improvements but serves as an academic exercise to validate
the reproducibility of the SRGAN’s performance on public

benchmarks. This replication also provides insights into the prac-
tical aspects of deploying such deep learning models and their

behavior under different conditions and parameters. Our findings
reiterate the efficacy of the SRGAN model in super-resolution
tasks, emphasizing the importance of perceptual congruity in
the realm of image upscaling.
